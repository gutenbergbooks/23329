      &ldquo;LE MONSIEUR DE LA PETITE DAME&rdquo;
     </h1>
    <h2>
      By Frances Hodgson Burnett
    </h2>
    <h4>
      Copyright, 1877

    <p>
      <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Madame who first entered the box, and Madame was bright with
      youthful bloom, bright with jewels, and, moreover, a beauty. She was a
      little creature, with childishly large eyes, a low, white forehead,
      reddish-brown hair, and Greek nose and mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Clearly,&rdquo; remarked the old lady in the box opposite, &ldquo;not a Frenchwoman.
      Her youth is too girlish, and she has too petulant an air of
      indifference.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This old lady in the box opposite was that venerable and somewhat severe
      aristocrat, Madame de Castro, and having gazed for a moment or so a little
      disapprovingly at the new arrival, she turned her glasses to the young
      beauty&rsquo;s companion and uttered an exclamation.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was at Monsieur she was looking now. Monsieur had followed his wife
      closely, bearing her fan and bouquet and wrap, and had silently seated him
      self a little behind her and in the shadow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Ciel!</i>&rdquo; cried Madame de Castro, &ldquo;what an ugly little man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was not an unnatural exclamation. Fate had not been so kind to the
      individual referred to as she might have been&mdash;in fact she had been
      definitely cruel. He was small of figure, insignificant, dark, and wore a
      patient sphynx-like air of gravity. He did not seem to speak or move,
      simply sat in the shadow holding his wife&rsquo;s belongings, apparently almost
      entirely unnoticed by her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know him at all,&rdquo; said Madame de Castro; &ldquo;though that is not to
      be wondered at, since I have exiled myself long enough to forget and be
      forgotten by half Paris. What is his name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman at her side&mdash;a distinguished-looking old young man,
      with a sarcastic smile&mdash;began with the smile, and ended with a half
      laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They call him,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;Le Monsieur de la petite Dame. His name is
      Villefort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Le Monsieur de la petite Dame,&rdquo; repeated Madame, testily. &ldquo;That is a
      title of new Paris&mdash;the Paris of your Americans and English. It is
      villainously ill-bred.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      M. Renard&rsquo;s laugh receded into the smile again, and the smile became of
      double significance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True,&rdquo; he acquiesced, &ldquo;but it is also villainously apropos. Look for
      yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame did so, and her next query, after she had dropped her glass again,
      was a sharp one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is she&mdash;the wife?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is what you are pleased to call one of our Americans! You know the
      class,&rdquo;&mdash;with a little wave of the hand,&mdash;&ldquo;rich, unconventional,
      comfortable people, who live well and dress well, and have an
      incomprehensibly <i>naïve</i> way of going to impossible places and doing
      impossible things by way of enjoyment. Our fair friend there, for
      instance, has probably been round the world upon several occasions, and is
      familiar with a number of places and objects of note fearful to
      contemplate. They came here as tourists, and became fascinated with
      European life. The most overwhelming punishment which could be inflicted
      upon that excellent woman, the mother, would be that she should be
      compelled to return to her New York, or Philadelphia, or Boston,
      whichsoever it may be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; commented Madame. &ldquo;But you have not told me the name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame Villefort&rsquo;s? No, not yet. It was Trent&mdash;Mademoiselle Bertha
      Trent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is not twenty yet,&rdquo; said Madame, in a queer, grumbling tone. &ldquo;What
      did she marry that man for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God knows,&rdquo; replied M. Renard, not too devoutly, &ldquo;Paris does not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For some reason best known to herself, Madame de Castro looked angry. She
      was a shrewd old person, with strong whims of her own, even at seventy.
      She quite glared at the pretty American from under her bushy eyebrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Le Monsieur de la petite Dame!&rdquo; she fumed. &ldquo;I tell you it is low&mdash;<i>low</i>
      to give a man such names.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; returned Renard, shrugging his shoulders, &ldquo;we did not give it to
      him. It was an awkward servant who dubbed him so at first. She was new to
      her position, and forgot his name, and being asked who had arrived,
      stumbled upon this <i>bon mot: &lsquo;Un monsieur, Madame&mdash;le monsieur de
      la petite dame,&rsquo;&rsquo;</i>&mdash;and, being repeated and tossed lightly from
      hand to hand, it has become at last an established witticism, albeit
      bandied under breath.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was characteristic of the august De Castro that during the remainder of
      the evening&rsquo;s entertainment she should occupy herself more with her
      neighbors than with the opera. She aroused M. Renard to a secret ecstasy
      of mirth by the sharp steadiness of her observation of the inmates of the
      box opposite to them. She talked about them, too, in a tone not too well
      modulated, criticising the beautifully dressed little woman, her hair, her
      eyes, her Greek nose and mouth, and, more than all, her indifferent
      expression and her manner of leaning upon the edge of her box and staring
      at the stage as if she did not care for, and indeed scarcely saw, what was
      going on upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the way with your American beauties,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;They have no
      respect for things. Their people spoil them&mdash;their men especially.
      They consider themselves privileged to act as their whims direct. They
      have not the gentle timidity of Frenchwomen. What French girl would have
      the <i>sang froid</i> to sit in one of the best boxes of the Nouvelle
      Opéra and regard, with an actual air of <i>ennui</i>, such a performance
      as this? She does not hear a word that is sung.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And we&mdash;do we hear?&rdquo; bantered M. Renard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Pouf!</i>&rdquo; cried Madame. &ldquo;We! We are world-dried and weather-beaten.
      We have not a worm-eaten emotion between us. I am seventy, and you, who
      are thirty-five, are the elder of the two. Bah! At that girl&rsquo;s age I had
      the heart of a dove.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that is long ago,&rdquo; murmured M. Renard, as if to himself. It was quite
      human that he should slightly resent being classed with an unamiable
      grenadier of seventy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; with considerable asperity. &ldquo;Fifty years!&rdquo; Then, with harsh voice
      and withered face melted suddenly into softness quite <i>naïve, &ldquo;Mon Dieu!</i>&rdquo;
       she said, &ldquo;Fifty years since Arsène whispered into my ear at my first
      opera, that he saw tears in my eyes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was at this instant that there appeared in the Villefort box a new
      figure,&mdash;that of a dark, slight young man of graceful movements,&mdash;in
      fact, a young man of intensely striking appearance. M. Villefort rose to
      receive him with serious courtesy, but the pretty American was not so
      gracious. Not until he had seated himself at her side and spoken to her
      did she turn her head and permit her eyes simply to rest upon his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      M. Renard smiled again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enter,&rdquo; he remarked in a low tone,&mdash;&ldquo;enter M. Ralph Edmondstone, the
      cousin of Madame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His companion asked no questions, but he proceeded, returning to his light
      and airy tone:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. Ralph Edmondstone is a genius,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He is an artist, he is a
      poet, he is also a writer of subtile prose. His sonnets to Euphrasie&mdash;in
      the day of Euphrasie&mdash;awakened the admiration of the sternest
      critics: they were so tender, so full of purest fire! Some of the same
      critics also could scarcely choose between these and his songs to Aglæ in
      her day, or Camille in hers. He is a young man of fine fancies, and
      possesses the amiable quality of being invariably passionately in earnest.
      As he was serious in his sentiments yesterday, so he will be to-morrow, so
      he is to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-day!&rdquo; echoed Madame de Castro. &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame Villefort did not seem to talk much. It was M. Ralph Edmondstone
      who conversed, and that, too, with so much of the charm of animation that
      it was pleasurable even to be a mere looker-on.
    </p>
    <p>
      One involuntarily strained one&rsquo;s ears to catch a sentence,&mdash;he was so
      eagerly absorbed, so full of rapid, gracefully unconscious and
      unconventional gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder what he is saying?&rdquo; Madame de Castro was once betrayed into
      exclaiming.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something metaphysical, about a poem, or a passage of music, or a
      picture,&mdash;or perhaps his soul,&rdquo; returned M. Renard. &ldquo;His soul is his
      strong point,&mdash;he pets it and wonders at it. He puts it through its
      paces. And yet, singularly enough, he is never ridiculous&mdash;only
      fanciful and <i>naïve</i>. It is his soul which so fascinates women.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whether this last was true of other women or not, Madame Villefort
      scarcely appeared fascinated. As she listened, her eyes still rested upon
      his eager mobile face, but with a peculiar expression,&mdash;an expression
      of critical attention, and yet one which somehow detracted from her look
      of youth, as if she weighed his words as they fell from his lips and
      classified them, without any touch of the enthusiasm which stirred within
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly she rose from her seat ana addressed her husband, who immediately
      rose also. Then she spoke to M. Edmondstone, and without more ado, the
      three left the box,&mdash;the young beauty, a little oddly, rather
      followed than accompanied by her companions,&mdash;at the recognition of
      which circumstance Madame de Castro uttered a series of sharp ejaculations
      of disapproval.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bah! Bah!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;She is too young for such airs!&mdash;as if she
      were Madame l&rsquo;Impératrice herself! Take me to my carriage. I am tired
      also.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Crossing the pavement with M. Renard, they passed the carriage of the
      Villeforts. Before its open door stood M. Villefort and Edmondstone, and
      the younger man, with bared head, bent forward speaking to his cousin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I come to-morrow,&rdquo; he was saying, &ldquo;you will be at home, Bertha?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, good-night,&rdquo;&mdash;holding out his hand,&mdash;&ldquo;only I wish so that
      you would go to the Aylmers instead of home. That <i>protégée</i> of Mrs.
      Aylmer&rsquo;s&mdash;the little singing girl&mdash;would touch your heart with
      her voice. On hearing her, one thinks at once of some shy wild bird high
      in a clear sky,&mdash;far enough above earth to have forgotten to be
      timid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; came quietly from the darkness within the carriage; &ldquo;but I am too
      tired to care about voices just now. Good-night, Ralph!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      M. Renard&rsquo;s reply of &ldquo;God knows, Paris does not,&rdquo; to Madame de Castro&rsquo;s
      query as to why Madame Villefort had married her husband, contained an
      element of truth, and yet there were numbers of Parisian-Americans, more
      especially the young, well-looking, and masculine, who at the time the
      marriage had taken place had been ready enough with sardonic explanations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are women who are avaricious enough to sell their souls,&rdquo; they
      cried; &ldquo;and the maternal Trent is one of them. The girl is only to blame
      for allowing herself to be bullied into the match.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the weak place in this argument,&rdquo; said M. Renard, &ldquo;is, that the
      people are too rich to be greatly influenced by money. If there had been a
      title,&mdash;but there was no title.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Neither did Bertha Trent comport herself like a cowed creature. She took
      her place in society as Madame Villefort in such a manner as could give
      rise to no comment whatever; only one or two of the restless inquisitive
      wondered if they had not been, mistaken in her. She was, as I have said
      already, a childishly small and slight creature,&mdash;the kind of woman
      to touch one with suggestions of helplessness and lack of will; and yet,
      notwithstanding this, a celebrated artist&mdash;a shrewd, worldly-wise old
      fellow&mdash;who had painted her portrait, had complained that he was not
      satisfied with it because he had not done justice to &ldquo;the obstinate
      endurance in her eye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was to her cousin, Ralph Edmondstone, he had said this with some degree
      of testiness, and Edmondstone had smiled and answered:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! have you found that out? Few people do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the time of the marriage Edmondstone had been in Rome singeing his
      wings in the light of the eyes of a certain Marchesa who was his latest
      poetic passion. She was not his first fancy, nor would she be his last,
      but she had power enough for the time being to have satisfied the most
      exacting of women.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was at his banker&rsquo;s when he heard the news spoken of as the latest item
      from American Paris, and his start and exclamation of disgust drew forth
      some cynical after-comment from men who envied him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who?&rdquo; he said, with indiscreet impatience. &ldquo;That undersized sphynx of a
      Villefort? Faugh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But insignificant though he might be, it was M. Villefort who had won, and
      if he was nothing more, he was at least a faithful attendant. Henceforth,
      those who saw his wife invariably saw him also,&mdash;driving with her in
      her carriage, riding with her courageously if ungracefully, standing or
      seated near her in the shadow of her box at the Nouvelle Opéra, silent,
      impassive, grave, noticeable only through the contrast he afforded to her
      girlish beauty and bloom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Always there!&rdquo; commented a sharp American belle of mature years, &ldquo;like an
      ugly little conscience.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Edmondstone&rsquo;s first meeting with his cousin after his return to Paris was
      accidental. He had rather put off visiting her, and one night, entering a
      crowded room, he found himself standing behind a girl&rsquo;s light figure and
      staring at an abundance of reddish-brown hair. When, almost immediately
      the pretty head to which this hair belonged turned with a slow, yet
      involuntary-looking movement toward him, he felt that he became excited
      without knowing why.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Bertha!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled a little and held out her hand, and he immediately became
      conscious of M. Villefort being quite near and regarding him seriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the perverseness of fate that he should find in Bertha Villefort
      even more than he had once seen in Bertha Trent, and there had been a time
      when he had seen a great deal in Bertha Trent. In the Trent household he
      had been a great favorite. No social evening or family festivity had
      seemed complete without his presence. The very children had felt that they
      had a claim upon his good-humor, and his tendency to break forth into
      whimsical frolic. Good Mrs. Trent had been wont to scold him and gossip
      with him. He had read his sonnets and metaphysical articles to Bertha, and
      occasionally to the rest; in fact, his footing in the family was familiar
      and firmly established. But since her marriage Bertha had become a little
      incomprehensible, and on that account a little more interesting. He was
      sure she had developed, but could not make out in what direction. He found
      occasion to reproach her sometimes with the changes he found in her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are times when I hardly know you,&rdquo; he would say, &ldquo;you are so finely
      orthodox and well controlled. It was not so with you once, Bertha. Don&rsquo;t&mdash;don&rsquo;t
      become that terrible thing, a fine lady, and worse still, a fine lady who
      is <i>désillusionée</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It baffled him that she never appeared much moved, by his charges.
      Certainly she lived the life of a &ldquo;fine lady,&rdquo;&mdash;a brilliant life, a
      luxurious one, a life full of polite dissipation. Once, when in a tenderly
      fraternal mood, he reproached her with this also, she laughed at him
      frankly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is absinthe,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It is my absinthe at least, and who does not
      drink a little absinthe&mdash;of one kind or another?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was sincerely convinced that from this moment he understood and had the
      right to pity and watch over her. He went oftener to see her. In her
      presence he studied her closely, absent he brooded over her. He became
      impatiently intolerant of M. Villefort, and prone to condemn him, he
      scarcely knew for what.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has no dignity&mdash;no perception,&rdquo; was his parental decision. &ldquo;He
      has not even the delicacy to love her, or he would have the tenderness to
      sacrifice his own feelings and leave her to herself. I could do it for a
      woman I loved.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But M. Villefort was always there,&mdash;gravely carrying the shawls,
      picking up handkerchiefs, and making himself useful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Imbécile!</i>&rdquo; muttered M. Renard under cover of his smile and his
      mustache, as he stood near his venerable patroness the first time she met
      the Villeforts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blockhead!&rdquo; stealthily ejaculated that amiable aristocrat. But though she
      looked grimly at M. Villefort, M. Renard was uncomfortably uncertain that
      it was he to whom she referred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go and bring them to me,&rdquo; she commanded, &ldquo;Go and bring them to me before
      some one else engages them. I want to talk to that girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was astonishing how agreeable she made herself to her victims when she
      had fairly entrapped them. Bertha hesitated a little before accepting her
      offer of a seat at her side, but once seated she found herself oddly
      amused. When Madame de Castro chose to rake the embers of her seventy
      years, many a lively coal discovered itself among the ashes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing the two women together, Edmondstone shuddered in fastidious
      protest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How could you laugh at that detestable old woman?&rdquo; he exclaimed on
      encountering Bertha later in the evening. &ldquo;I wonder that M. Villefort
      would permit her to talk to you. She is a wicked, cynical creature, who
      has the hardihood to laugh at her sins instead of repenting of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps that is the reason she is so amusing,&rdquo; said Bertha.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edmondstone answered her with gentle mournfulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Have you begun to say such things? You too, Bertha&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      The laugh with which she stopped him was both light and hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is M. Villefort?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;I have actually not seen him for
      fifteen minutes. Is it possible that Madame de Castro has fascinated him
      into forgetting me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Edmondstone went to his hotel that night in a melancholy mood. He even lay
      awake to think what a dreary mistake his cousin&rsquo;s marriage was. She had
      been such a tender and easily swayed little soul as a girl, and now it
      really seemed as if she was hardening into a woman of the world. In the
      old times he had been wont to try his sonnets upon Bertha as a musician
      tries his chords upon his most delicate instrument. Even now he remembered
      certain fine, sensitive expressions of hers which had thrilled him beyond
      measure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How could she marry such a fellow as that&mdash;how could she?&rdquo; he
      groaned. &ldquo;What does it mean? It must mean something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was pale and heavy-eyed when he wandered round to the Villeforts&rsquo; the
      following morning. M. Villefort was sitting with Bertha and reading aloud.
      He stopped to receive their visitor punctiliously and inquire after his
      health.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. Edmondstone cannot have slept well,&rdquo; he remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not sleep at all,&rdquo; Edmondstone answered, &ldquo;and naturally have a
      headache.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bertha pointed to a wide lounge of the <i>pouf</i> order.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then go to sleep now,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;M. Villefort will read. When I have a
      headache he often reads me to sleep, and I am always better on awaking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Involuntarily Edmondstone half frowned. Absurdly enough, he resented in
      secret this amiability on the part of M. Villefort toward his own wife. He
      was quite prepared to be severe upon the reading, but was surprised to be
      compelled to acknowledge that M. Villefort read wondrously well, and
      positively with hints of delicate perception. His voice was full and yet
      subtly flexible. Edmondstone tried to protest against this also, but
      uselessly. Finally he was soothed, and from being fretfully wide-awake
      suddenly passed into sleep as Bertha had commanded. How long his slumber
      lasted he could not have told. All at once he found himself aroused and
      wide-awake as ever. His headache had departed; his every sense seemed to
      have gained keenness. M. Villefort&rsquo;s voice had ceased, and for a few
      seconds utter, dead silence reigned. Then he heard the fire crackling, and
      shortly afterward a strange, startling sound&mdash;a sharp, gasping sob!
    </p>
    <p>
      The pang which seized upon him was strong indeed. In one moment he seemed
      to learn a thousand things by intuition&mdash;to comprehend her, himself,
      the past. Before he moved he knew that Villefort was not in the room, and
      he had caught a side glimpse of the pretty blue of Bertha&rsquo;s dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he had not imagined the face he saw when he turned his head to look at
      her. She sat in a rigid attitude, leaning against the high cushioned back
      of her chair, her hands clasped above her head. She stared at the fire
      with eyes wide and strained with the agony of tears unshed, and amid the
      rush of all other emotions he was peculiarly conscious of being touched by
      the minor one of his recognition of her look of extreme youth&mdash;the
      look which had been wont to touch people in the girl, Bertha Trent. He had
      meant to speak clearly, but his voice was only a loud whisper when he
      sprang up, uttering her name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bertha! Bertha! Bertha!&rdquo; as he flung himself upon his knees at her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her answer was an actual cry, and yet it reached no higher pitch than his
      own intense whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you were asleep?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her hands fell and he caught them. His sad impassioned face bowed itself
      upon her palms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am awake, Bertha,&rdquo; he groaned. &ldquo;I am awake&mdash;at last.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She regarded him with a piteous, pitying glance. She knew him with a
      keener, sadder knowledge than he would ever comprehend; but she did not
      under-estimate the depth of his misery at this one overwhelming moment. He
      was awake indeed and saw what he had lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you could but have borne with me a little longer,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If I had
      only not been so shallow and so blind. If you could but have borne with me
      a little longer!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I could but have borne with myself a little longer,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;If
      I could but have borne a little longer with my poor, base pride! Because I
      suffered myself, I have made another suffer too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He knew she spoke of M. Villefort, and the thought jarred upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He does not suffer,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He is not of the fibre to feel pain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he wondered why she shrank from him a little and answered with a sad
      bitterness:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you sure? You did not know that!&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me,&rdquo; he said brokenly, the face he lifted, haggard with his
      unhappiness. &ldquo;Forgive me, for I have lost so much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She wasted few words and no tears. The force and suddenness of his emotion
      and her own had overborne her into this strange unmeant confession; but
      her mood was unlike his,&mdash;it was merely receptive. She listened to
      his unavailing regrets, but told him little of her own past.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It does not matter,&rdquo; she said drearily. &ldquo;It is all over. Let it rest. The
      pain of to-day and tomorrow is enough for us. We have borne yesterday; why
      should we want it back again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And when they parted she said only one thing of the future:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no need that we should talk. There is nothing for us beyond this
      point. We can only go back. We must try to forget&mdash;and be satisfied
      with our absinthe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Instead of returning to his hotel, Edmondstone found his way to the Champs
      Élysées, and finally to the Bois. He was too wretched to have any purpose
      in his wanderings. He walked rapidly, looking straight before him and
      seeing nobody. He scarcely understood his own fierce emotions Hitherto his
      fancies had brought him a vague rapture; now he experienced absolute
      anguish, Every past experience had become trivial. What happiness is so
      keen as one&rsquo;s briefest pain? As he walked he lived again the days he had
      thrown away. He remembered a thousand old, yet new, phases of Bertha&rsquo;s
      girlhood. He thought of times when she had touched or irritated or pleased
      him. When he had left Paris for Rome she had not bidden him good-by.
      Jenny, her younger sister, had told him that she was not well.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I had seen her then,&rdquo; he cried inwardly, &ldquo;I might have read her heart&mdash;and
      my own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      M. Renard, riding a very tall horse in the Bois, passed him and raised his
      eyebrows at the sight of his pallor and his fagged yet excited look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There will be a new sonnet,&rdquo; he said to himself. &ldquo;A sonnet to Despair, or
      Melancholy, or Loss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Afterward, when society became a little restive and eager, M. Renard
      looked on with sardonic interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That happy man, M. Villefort,&rdquo; he said to Madame de Castro, &ldquo;is a good
      soul&mdash;a good soul. He has no small jealous follies,&rdquo; and his smile
      was scarcely a pleasant thing to see.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is nothing for us beyond this past,&rdquo; Bertha had said, and
      Edmondstone had agreed with her hopelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he could not quite break away. Sometimes for a week the Villeforts
      missed him, and then again they saw him every day. He spent his mornings
      with them, joined them in their drives, at their opera-box, or at the
      entertainments of their friends. He also fell into his old place in the
      Trent household, and listened with a vague effort at interest to Mrs.
      Trent&rsquo;s maternal gossip about the boys&rsquo; college expenses, Bertha&rsquo;s
      household, and Jenny&rsquo;s approaching social <i>début</i> He was continually
      full of a feverish longing to hear of Bertha,&mdash;to hear her name
      spoken, her ingoings and out-comings discussed, her looks, her belongings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fact is,&rdquo; said Mrs. Trent, as the winter advanced, &ldquo;I am anxious
      about Bertha. She does not look strong. I don&rsquo;t know why I have not seen
      it before, but all at once I found out yesterday that she is really thin.
      She was always slight and even a little fragile, but now she is actually
      thin. One can see the little bones in her wrists and fingers. Her rings
      and her bracelets slip about quite loosely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And talking of being thin, mother,&rdquo; cried Jenny, who was a frank, bright
      sixteen-year-old, &ldquo;look at cousin Ralph himself. He has little hollows in
      his cheeks, and his eyes are as much too big as Bertha&rsquo;s. Is the sword
      wearing out the scabbard, Ralph? That is what they always say about
      geniuses, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ralph has not looked well for some time,&rdquo; said Mrs. Trent. &ldquo;As for
      Bertha, I think I shall scold her a little, and M. Villefort too. She has
      been living too exciting a life. She is out continually. She must stay at
      home more and rest. It is rest she needs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you tell Arthur that Bertha looks ill &ldquo;&mdash;began Jenny.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edmondstone turned toward her sharply. &ldquo;Arthur!&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;Who is
      Arthur?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Trent answered with a comfortable laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is M. Villefort&rsquo;s name,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;though none of us call him Arthur
      but Jenny. Jenny and he are great friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like him better than any one else,&rdquo; said Jenny stoutly. &ldquo;And I wish to
      set a good example to Bertha, who never calls him anything but M.
      Villefort, which is absurd. Just as if they had been introduced to each
      other about a week ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I always hear him address her as Madame Villefort,&rdquo; reflected
      Edmondstone, somewhat gloomily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes!&rdquo; answered Jenny, &ldquo;that is his French way of studying her fancies.
      He would consider it taking an unpardonable liberty to call her &lsquo;Bertha,&rsquo; 
      since she only favors him with &lsquo;M. Villefort.&rsquo; I said to him only the
      other day, &lsquo;Arthur, you are the oddest couple! You&rsquo;re so grand and
      well-behaved, I cannot imagine you scolding Bertha a little, and I have
      never seen you kiss her since you were married.&rsquo; I was half frightened
      after I had said it. He started as if he had been shot, and turned as pale
      as death. I really felt as if I had done something frightfully improper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The French are so different from the Americans,&rdquo; said Mrs. Trent,
      &ldquo;particularly those of M. Villefort&rsquo;s class. They are beautifully
      punctilious, but I don&rsquo;t call it quite comfortable, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her mother was not the only person who noticed a change in Bertha
      Villefort. Before long it was a change so marked that all who saw her
      observed it. She had become painfully frail and slight. Her face looked
      too finely cut, her eyes had shadowy hollows under them, and were always
      bright with a feverish excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter with your wife?&rdquo; demanded Madame de Castro of M.
      Villefort. Since their first meeting she had never loosened her hold upon
      the husband and wife, and had particularly cultivated Bertha.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no change in the expression of M. Villefort, but he was
      strangely pallid as he made his reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is impossible for me to explain, Madame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is absolutely attenuated,&rdquo; cried Madame» &ldquo;She is like a spirit. Take
      her to the country&mdash;to Normandy&mdash;to the sea&mdash;somewhere! She
      will die if there is not a change. At twenty, one should be as plump as a
      young capon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A few days after this, Jenny Trent ran in upon Bertha as she lay upon a
      lounge, holding an open book, but with closed eyes. She had come to spend
      the morning, she announced. She wanted to talk&mdash;about people, about
      her dress, about her first ball which was to come off shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Arthur says&rdquo;&mdash;she began.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bertha turned her head almost as Edmondstone had done.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arthur!&rdquo; she repeated. For the second time Jenny felt a little
      embarrassed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean M. Villefort,&rdquo; she said, hesitantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She quite forgot what she had been going to say, and for a moment or so
      regarded the fire quite gravely. But naturally this could not last long.
      She soon began to talk again, and it was not many minutes before she found
      M. Villefort in her path once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never thought I could like a Frenchman so much,&rdquo; she said, in all
      enthusiastic good faith. &ldquo;At first, you know,&rdquo; with an apologetic half
      laugh, &ldquo;I wondered why you had not taken an American instead, when there
      were so many to choose from, but now I understand it. What beautiful
      tender things he can say, Bertha, and yet not seem in the least
      sentimental. Everything comes so simply right from the bottom of his
      heart. Just think what he said to me yesterday when he brought me those
      flowers. He helps me with mine, and it is odd how things will cheer up and
      grow for him, I said to him, &lsquo;Arthur, how is it that no flower ever fails
      you?&rsquo; and he answered in the gentlest quiet way, &lsquo;Perhaps because I never
      fail them. Flowers are like people,&mdash;one must love and be true to
      them, not only to-day and to-morrow, but every day&mdash;every hour&mdash;always.&rsquo; 
      And he says such things so often. That is why I am so fond of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As she received no reply, she turned toward the lounge. Bertha lay upon it
      motionless and silent,&mdash;only a large tear trembled on her cheek.
      Jenny sprung up, shocked and checked, and went to&rsquo; her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Bertha!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;how thoughtless I am to tire you so, you poor
      little soul! Is it true that you are so weak as all that? I heard mamma
      and Arthur talking about it, but I scarcely believed it. They said you
      must go to Normandy and be nursed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to go to Normandy,&rdquo; said Bertha, &ldquo;I&mdash;I am too tired. I
      only want to lie still and rest. I have been out too much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her voice, however, was so softly weak that in the most natural manner
      Jenny was subdued into shedding a few tears also, and kissed her
      fervently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Bertha!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you must do anything&mdash;anything that will
      make you well&mdash;if it is only for Arthur&rsquo;s sake. He loves you so&mdash;so
      terribly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whereupon Bertha laughed a little hysterically. &ldquo;Does he,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;love
      me so &lsquo;terribly&rsquo;? Poor M. Villefort?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not go to Normandy, however, and still went into society, though
      not as much as had been her habit. When she spent her evenings at home,
      some of her own family generally spent them with her, and M. Villefort or
      Edmondstone read aloud or talked.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, Edmondstone came oftener than ever. His anxiety and unhappiness
      grew upon him, and made him moody, irritable, and morbid.
    </p>
    <p>
      One night, when M. Villefort had left them alone together for a short
      time, he sprang from his chair and came to her couch, shaken with
      suppressed emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That man is killing you!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;You are dying by inches! I
      cannot bear it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not <i>he</i> who is killing me,&rdquo; she answered; and then M.
      Villefort returned to the room with the book he had been in search of.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this case Edmondstone&rsquo;s passion took new phases. He wrote no sonnets,
      painted no pictures. He neglected his work, and spent his idle hours in
      rambling here and there in a gloomy, unsociable fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He looks,&rdquo; said M. Renard, &ldquo;as if his soul had been playing him some evil
      trick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had at first complained that Bertha had taken a capricious fancy to
      Madame de Castro, but in course of time he found his way to the old
      woman&rsquo;s <i>salon</i> too, though it must be confessed that Madame herself
      never showed him any great favor. But this he did not care for. He only
      cared to sit in the same room with Bertha, and watch her every movement
      with a miserable tenderness.
    </p>
    <p>
      One night, after regarding him cynically for some time, Madame broke out
      to Bertha with small ceremony:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a fool that young man is!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;He sits and fairly
      devours you with his eyes. It is bad taste to show such an insane passion
      for a married woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It seemed as if Bertha lost at once her breath and every drop of blood in
      her body, for she had neither breath nor color when she turned and looked
      Madame de Castro in the face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;if you repeat that to me, you will never see me again&mdash;never!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Upon which Madame snapped her up with some anger at being so rebuked for
      her frankness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it is worse than I thought,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was weeks before she saw her young friend again. Indeed, it required
      some clever diplomacy to heal the breach made, and even in her most
      amusing and affectionate moods, she often felt afterward that she was
      treated with a reserve which held her at arm&rsquo;s length.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the time the horse-chestnuts bloomed pink and white on the Avenue des
      Champs Élysées, there were few people in the Trent and Villefort circles
      who had not their opinions on the subject of Madame Villefort and her
      cousin.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a mixture of French and American gossip and comment, frank
      satire, or secret remark. But to her credit be it spoken, Madame de Castro
      held grim silence, and checked a rumor occasionally with such amiable
      ferocity as was not without its good effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pink and white blossoms were already beginning to strew themselves at
      the feet of the pedestrians, when one morning M. Villefort presented
      himself to Madame, and discovered her sitting alone in the strangest of
      moods.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought I might have the pleasure of driving home with Madame
      Villefort. My servant informed me that I should find her here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame de Castro pointed to a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down,&rdquo; she commanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      M. Villefort obeyed her in some secret but well-concealed amazement. He
      saw that she was under the influence of some unusual excitement. Her false
      front was pushed fantastically away, her rouge and powder were rubbed off
      in patches, her face looked set and hard. Her first words were abominably
      blunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. Villefort,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;do you know what your acquaintances call you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A deep red rose slowly to his face, but he did not answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know that you are designated by them by an absurd title&mdash;that
      they call you in ridicule &lsquo;Le Monsieur de la petite Dame?&rsquo; Do you know
      that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His look was incomprehensible, but he bowed gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;since others have heard the title so often, it is
      but natural that I myself should have heard it more than once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She regarded him in angry amazement. She was even roused to rapping upon
      the floor with her gold-headed cane.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does it not affect you?&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Does it not move you to
      indignation?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That, Madame,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;can only be my affair. My friends will allow
      me my emotions at least.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then she left her chair and began to walk up and down, striking the carpet
      hard with her cane at every step.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a strange man,&rdquo; she remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, however, when just on the point of starting upon a fresh tour,
      she wheeled about and addressed him sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I respect you,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;and because I respect you, I will do you a
      good turn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She made no pretense at endeavoring to soften the blow she was about to
      bestow. She drew forth from her dress a letter, the mere sight of which
      seemed to goad her to a mysterious excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See,&rdquo; she cried; &ldquo;it was M. Ralph Edmondstone who wrote this,&mdash;it
      was to Madame Villefort it was written. It means ruin and dishonor. I
      offer it to you to read.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      M. Villefort rose and laid his hand upon his chair to steady himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;I will not touch it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She struck herself upon her withered breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Behold me!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;<i>Me!</i> I am seventy years old! Good God!
      seventy! I am a bad old woman, and it is said I do not repent of my sins.
      I, too, have been a beautiful young girl. I, too, had my first lover. I,
      too, married a man who had not won my heart. It does not matter that the
      husband was worthy and the lover was not,&mdash;one learns that too late.
      My fate was what your wife&rsquo;s will be if you will not sacrifice your pride
      and save her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pride!&rdquo; he echoed in a bitter, hollow voice. &ldquo;My pride, Madame!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She went on without noticing him:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They have been here this morning&mdash;both of them. He followed her, as
      he always does. He had a desperate look which warned me. Afterward I found
      the note upon the floor. Now will you read it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; he cried, as he fell into his chair again, his brow sinking
      into his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have read it,&rdquo; said Madame, with a tragic gesture, &ldquo;and I choose to
      place one stumbling-block in the path that would lead her to an old age
      like mine. I do not like your Americans; but I have sometimes seen in her
      girl&rsquo;s face a proud, heroic endurance of the misery she has brought upon
      herself, and it has moved me. And this let ter&mdash;you should read it,
      to see how such a man can plead. It is a passionate cry of despair&mdash;it
      is a poem in itself. I, myself, read it with sobs in my throat and tears
      in my eyes. &lsquo;If you love me!&mdash;if you have ever loved me!&rsquo; he cries,
      &lsquo;for God&rsquo;s sake!&mdash;for love&rsquo;s sake!&mdash;if there is love on earth&mdash;if
      there is a God in heaven, you will not let me implore you in vain!&rsquo; And
      his prayer is that she will leave Paris with him tonight&mdash;. to-night!
      There! Monsieur, I have done. Behold the letter! Take it or leave it, as
      you please.&rdquo; And she flung it upon the floor at his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      She paused a moment, wondering what he would do.
    </p>
    <p>
      He bent down and picked the letter up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will take it,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      All at once he had become calm, and when he rose and uttered his last
      words to her, there was upon his face a faint smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I, too,&rdquo; he said,&mdash;&ldquo;I, too, Madame, suffer from a mad and hopeless
      passion, and thus can comprehend the bitterness of M. Edmondstone&rsquo;s pangs.
      I, too, would implore in the name of love and God,&mdash;if I might, but I
      may not.&rdquo; And so he took his departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Until evening Bertha did not see him. The afternoon she spent alone and in
      writing letters, and having completed and sealed the last, she went to her
      couch and tried to sleep. One entering the room, as she lay upon the
      violet cushions, her hands at her sides, her eyes closed, might well have
      been shocked. Her spotless pallor, the fine sharpness of her face, the
      shadows under her eyes, her motionlessness, would have excused the
      momentary feeling. But she was up and dressed for dinner when M. Villefort
      presented himself. Spring though it was, she was attired in a high, close
      dress of black velvet, and he found her almost cowering over the open
      fire-place. Strangely enough, too, she fancied that when she looked up at
      him she saw him shiver, as if he were struck with a slight chill also.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You should not wear that,&rdquo; he said, with a half smile at her gown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It makes you so white&mdash;so much like a too early lily. But&mdash;but
      perhaps you thought of going out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she answered; &ldquo;not to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He came quite close to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you are not too greatly fatigued,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it would give me
      happiness to take you with me on my errand to your mother&rsquo;s house. I must
      carry there my little birthday gift to your sister,&rdquo; smiling again.
    </p>
    <p>
      An expression of embarrassment showed itself upon her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;to think that I had forgotten it! She will feel as
      if I did not care for her at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She seemed for the moment quite unhappy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me see what you have chosen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He drew from his pocket a case and opened it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;how pretty and how suitable for a girl!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were the prettiest, most airy set of pearls imaginable.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat and looked at them for a few seconds thoughtfully, and then handed
      them back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very good, and Jenny will be in ecstasies,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a happiness to me to give her pleasure,&rdquo; he returned. &ldquo;I feel great
      tenderness for her. She is not like the young girls I have known. Her
      innocence is of a frank and noble quality, which is better than ignorance.
      One could not bear that the slightest shadow of sin or pain should fall
      upon her. The atmosphere surrounding her is so bright with pure happiness
      and the courage of youth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Involuntarily he held out his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you&rdquo;&mdash;he began. His voice fell and broke. &ldquo;Will you go with
      me?&rdquo; he ended.
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw that she was troubled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now?&rdquo; she faltered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a peculiar pause,&mdash;a moment, as it seemed to him, of
      breathless silence. This silence she broke by her rising slowly from her
      seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she responded, &ldquo;I will go. Why should I not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was midnight when they left the Trents&rsquo;, and Jenny stood upon the
      threshold, a bright figure in a setting of brightness, and kissed her hand
      to them as they went down the steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you will be better to-morrow, Arthur,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned quickly to look up at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. You look so tired. I might say haggard, if it was polite.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would not be polite,&rdquo; said Bertha, &ldquo;so don&rsquo;t say it. Good-night,
      Jenny!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But when they were seated in the carriage she glanced at her husband&rsquo;s
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Are</i> you unwell?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      He passed his hand quickly across his forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A little fatigued,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;It is nothing. To-morrow&mdash;to-morrow
      it will be all over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so silence fell upon them.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they entered the drawing-room a clock chimed the half hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So late as that!&rdquo; exclaimed Bertha, and sank into a chair with a faint
      laugh. &ldquo;Why, to-day is over,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It is to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      M. Villefort had approached a side table. Upon it lay a peculiar-looking
      oblong box.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; he said, softly, &ldquo;they have arrived.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are they?&rdquo; Bertha asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was bending over the box to open it, and did not turn toward her, as he
      replied:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a gift for a young friend of mine,&mdash;a brace of pistols. He has
      before him a long journey in the East, and he is young enough to have a
      fancy for firearms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was still examining the weapons when Bertha crossed the room on her way
      up-stairs, and she paused an instant to look at them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are very handsome,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;One could almost wear them as
      ornaments.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But they would have too threatening a look,&rdquo; he answered, lightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he raised his eyes they met hers. She half started backward, moved by a
      new sense of the haggardness of his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You <i>are</i> ill!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;You are as colorless as marble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you, too,&rdquo; he returned, still with the same tender lightness. &ldquo;Let us
      hope that our &lsquo;to-morrow&rsquo; will find us both better, and you say it is
      tomorrow now. Good-night!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She went away without saying more. Weary as she was, she knew there was no
      sleep for her, and after dismissing her maid, she threw herself upon the
      lounge before the bedroom fire and lay there. To-night she felt as if her
      life had reached its climax. She burst into a passion of tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jenny! Jenny!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;how I envy&mdash;how I envy you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The recollection of Jenny shining in her pretty gala dress, and delighting
      in her birthday presents, and everybody else&rsquo;s pride and affection, filled
      her with a morbid misery and terror. She covered her face with her hands
      as she thought of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Once,&rdquo; she panted, &ldquo;as I looked at her tonight, for a moment I almost
      hated her. Am I so bad as that?&mdash;am I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Scarcely two seconds afterward she had sprung to her feet and was standing
      by the side of her couch, her heart beating with a rapid throb of fright,
      her limbs trembling. A strange sound had fallen suddenly upon the perfect
      silence of the night&mdash;a sound loud, hard, and sharp&mdash;the report
      of a pistol! What dread seized her she knew not. She was across the room
      and had wrenched the door open in an instant, then with flying feet down
      the corridor and the staircase. But half-way down the stairs she began to
      cry out aloud, &ldquo;Arthur! Arthur!&rdquo; not conscious of her own voice&mdash;&ldquo;Arthur,
      what is it?&rdquo; The door of the drawing-room flew open before the fierce
      stroke of her palm.
    </p>
    <p>
      M. Villefort stood where she had left him; but while his left hand
      supported his weight against the table, his right was thrust into his
      breast. One of the pistols lay at his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      She thought it was Death&rsquo;s self that confronted her in his face, but he
      spoke to her, trying faintly to smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not come in,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I have met with&mdash;an accident. It is
      nothing. Do not come in. A servant&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His last recollection was of her white face and white draperies as he
      fell, and somehow, dizzy, sick, and faint as he was, he seemed to hear her
      calling out, in a voice strangely like Jenny&rsquo;s, &ldquo;Arthur! Arthur!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In less than half an hour the whole house was astir. Upstairs physicians
      were with the wounded man, downstairs Mrs. Trent talked and wept over her
      daughter, after the manner of all good women. She was fairly terrified by
      Bertha&rsquo;s strange shudderings, quick, strained breath, and dilated eyes.
      She felt as if she could not reach her&mdash;as if she hardly made herself
      heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must calm yourself, Bertha,&rdquo; she would say. &ldquo;Try to calm yourself. We
      must hope for the best. Oh, how could it have happened!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was in the midst of this that a servant entered with a letter, which he
      handed to his mistress. The envelope bore upon it nothing but her own
      name.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at it with a bewildered expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For me?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It fell from Monsieur&rsquo;s pocket as we carried him upstairs,&rdquo; replied the
      man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mind it now, Bertha,&rdquo; said her mother, &ldquo;Ah, poor M. Villefort!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Bertha had opened it mechanically and was reading it
    </p>
    <p>
      At first it seemed as if it must have been written in a language she did
      not understand; but after the first few sentences a change appeared. Her
      breath came and went more quickly than before&mdash;a kind of horror grew
      in her eyes. At the last she uttered a low, struggling cry. The paper was
      crushed in her hand, she cast one glance around the room as if in
      bewildering search for refuge, and flung herself upon her mother&rsquo;s breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Save me, mother!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Help me! If he dies now, I shall go mad!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Afterward, in telling her story at home, good Mrs. Trent almost broke
      down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Jenny!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Just to think of the poor fellow&rsquo;s having had it
      in his pocket then! Of course I did not see it, but one can fancy that it
      was something kind and tender,&mdash;perhaps some little surprise he had
      planned for her. It seemed as if she could not bear it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      M. Villefort&rsquo;s accident was the subject of discussion for many days. He
      had purchased a wonderful pair of pistols as a gift for a young friend.
      How it had happened that one had been loaded none knew; it was just
      possible that he had been seized with the whim to load it himself&mdash;at
      all events, it had gone off in his hands. An inch&mdash;nay, half an inch&mdash;to
      the right, and Madame Villefort, who flew downstairs at the sound of the
      report, would only have found a dead man at her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Ma foi!</i>&rdquo; said M. Renard, repressing his smile; &ldquo;this is difficult
      for Monsieur, but it may leave &lsquo;<i>la petite Dame</i>&rsquo; at liberty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame de Castro flew at him with flashing eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silence!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;if you would not have me strike you with my cane.&rdquo;
       And she looked as if she were capable of doing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon his sick-bed M, Villefort was continually haunted by an apparition&mdash;an
      apparition of a white face and white draperies, such as he had seen as he
      fell. Sometimes it was here, sometimes there, sometimes near him, and
      sometimes indistinct and far away. Sometimes he called out to it and tried
      to extend his arms; again he lay and watched, it murmuring gentle words,
      and smiling mournfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Trent and the doctor were in despair. Madame Villefort obstinately
      refused to be forced from her husband&rsquo;s room. There were times when they
      thought she might sink and die there herself. She would not even leave it
      when they obliged her to sleep. Having been slight and frail from ill
      health before, she became absolutely attenuated. Soon all her beauty would
      be gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; said Mrs. Trent to her husband, &ldquo;I have found out that she
      always carries that letter in her breast? I see her put her hand to it in
      the strangest way a dozen times a day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One night, awakening from a long sleep to a clearer mental consciousness
      than usual, M. Villefort found his apparition standing over him.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood with one hand clinched upon her breast, and she spoke to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arthur!&rdquo; she said,&mdash;&ldquo;Arthur, do you know me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He answered her, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She slipped down upon her knees, and held up in her hand a letter crushed
      and broken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Try to keep your mind clear while you listen to me,&rdquo; she implored. &ldquo;Try&mdash;try!
      I must tell you, or I shall die. I am not the bad woman you think me. I
      never had read it&mdash;I had not seen it. I think he must have been mad.
      Once I loved him, but he killed my love himself. I could not have been bad
      like that, Jenny!&mdash;mother!&mdash;Arthur! believe me! believe me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In this supreme moment of her anguish and shame she forgot all else. She
      stretched forth her hands, panting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Believe me! It is true! Try to understand! Some one is coming! Say one
      word before it is too late!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;and I believe.&rdquo; He made a weak effort to
      touch her hand, but failed. He thought that perhaps it was the chill and
      numbness of death which stole over him and held him bound. When the nurse,
      whose footsteps they had heard, entered, she found him lying with glazed
      eyes, and Madame Villefort fallen in a swoon at the bedside.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet, from this time forward the outside world began to hear that his
      case was not so hopeless after all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Villefort will possibly recover,&rdquo; it was said at first; then, &ldquo;Villefort
      improves, it seems;&rdquo; and, at last, &ldquo;Villefort is out of danger Who would
      have thought it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nobody, however, could say that Madame had kept pace with her husband.
      When Monsieur was sufficiently strong to travel, and was advised to do so,
      there were grave doubts as to the propriety of his wife&rsquo;s accompanying
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she would not listen to those doubts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not stay in Paris,&rdquo; she said to her mother. &ldquo;I want to be free
      from it, and Jenny has promised to go with us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were to go into Normandy, and the day before their departure Ralph
      Edmondstone came to bid them good-bye.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the three he was by far the most haggard figure, and when Bertha came
      down to meet him in the empty drawing-room, he became a wretched figure
      with a broken, hopeless air, For a few seconds Bertha did not speak, but
      stood a pace or two away looking at him. It seemed, in truth, as she
      waited there in her dark, nun-like dress, that nearly all her beauty had
      left her. There remained only her large sad eyes and pretty hair, and the
      touching look of extreme youth. In her hand she held the crushed letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See!&rdquo; she said at last, holding this out to him. &ldquo;I am not so bad&mdash;so
      bad as that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He caught it from her hand and tore it into fragments. He was stabbed
      through and through with shame and remorse. After all, his love had been
      strong enough here, and his comprehension keen enough to have made him
      repent in the dust of the earth, in his first calm hour, the insult he had
      put upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me!&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;oh, forgive me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The few steps between them might have been a myriad of miles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did love you&mdash;long ago,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;but you never thought of me.
      You did not understand me then&mdash;nor afterward. All this winter my
      love has been dying a hard death. You tried to keep it alive, but&mdash;you
      did not understand. You only humiliated and tortured me&mdash;And I knew
      that if I had loved you more, you would have loved me less. See!&rdquo; holding
      up her thin hand, &ldquo;I have been worn out in the struggle between my
      unhappiness and remorse and you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not know what love is!&rdquo; he burst forth, stung into swift
      resentment.
    </p>
    <p>
      A quick sob broke from her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes I do.&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;I&mdash;I have seen it&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean M. Villefort!&rdquo; he cried in desperate jealous misery. &ldquo;You think
      that he&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She pointed to the scattered fragments of the letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He had that in his pocket when he fell,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;He thought that I had
      read it. If I had been your wife, and you had thought so, would you have
      thought that I was worth trying to save&mdash;as he tried to save me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; he exclaimed, shamefacedly. &ldquo;Has he seen it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered, with another sob, which might have been an echo of
      the first. &ldquo;And that is the worst of all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause, during which he looked down at the floor, and even
      trembled a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have done you more wrong than I thought,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she replied; &ldquo;a thousand-fold more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It seemed as if there might have been more to say, but it was not said.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a little while he roused himself with an effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not a villain!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I can do one thing. I can go to Villefort&mdash;if
      you care.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not speak. So he moved slowly away until he reached the door. With
      his hand upon the handle he turned and looked back at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it is good-bye&mdash;good-bye!&rdquo; he almost groaned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He could not help it&mdash;few men could have done so. His expression was
      almost fierce as he spoke his next words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you will love him&mdash;yes, you will love <i>him</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she answered, with bitter pain. &ldquo;I am not worthy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      It was a year or more before the Villeforts were seen in Paris again, and
      Jenny enjoyed her wanderings with them wondrously. In fact, she was the
      leading member of the party. She took them where she chose,&mdash;to queer
      places, to ugly places, to impossible places, but never from first to last
      to any place where there were not, or at least had not been, Americans as
      absurdly erratic as themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      The winter before their return they were at Genoa, among other places; and
      it was at Genoa that one morning, on opening a drawer, Bertha came upon an
      oblong box, the sight of which made her start backward and put her hand to
      her beating side. M. Villefort approached her hurriedly. An instant later,
      however, he started also and shut the drawer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come away,&rdquo; he said, taking her hand gently. &ldquo;Do not remain here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But he was pale, too, and his hand was unsteady. He led her to the window
      and made her sit down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I should not have left them there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did not send them to your friend?&rdquo; she faltered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stood for a moment or so, and looked out of the window at the blue sea
      which melted into the blue sky, at the blue sky which bent itself into the
      blue sea, at the white sails flecking the deep azure, at the waves
      hurrying in to break upon the sand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rdquo;&mdash;he said at length, tremulously, and with pale lips&mdash;&ldquo;that
      was false.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was false!&rdquo; she echoed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; hoarsely, &ldquo;it was false. There was no such friend. It was a lie&mdash;they
      were meant only for myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She uttered a low cry of anguish and dread.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, <i>mon Dieu!</i>&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You could not know. I understood all, and
      had been silent. I was nothing&mdash;a jest&mdash;&lsquo;<i>le Monsieur de la
      petite Dame</i>,&rsquo; as they said,&mdash;only that. I swore that I would save
      you. When I bade you adieu that night, I thought it was my last farewell.
      There was no accident. Yes&mdash;there was one. I did not die, as I had
      intended. My hand was not steady enough. And since then&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She rose up, crying out to him as she had done on that terrible night&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arthur! Arthur!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He came closer to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it true,&rdquo; he said,&mdash;&ldquo;is it true that my prayers have not been in
      vain? Is it true that at last&mdash;at last, you have learned&mdash;have
      learned&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stretched forth her arms to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Yes, it is true!&mdash;it is true!&rdquo;
